## Introduction
This project presents the results of data processing in **Reflex2D**. It includes the effects of various filters along with descriptions of their functions and examples of vectorization of data in echograms.

## Data Import into REFLEXW and Color Mapping
The data was imported into the ReflexW software, and the **hipis 6** color palette was chosen to enhance the visualization. Settings were configured in line with the provided instructional materials.

## Muting
When analyzing data from areas with high topographic variation, such as landslides, it is essential to apply a topographic correction using `'StaticCorrection/muting -> static correction'`, performed at the final stage of processing.

## Subtract DC-shift
The **Subtract DC-shift** function brings the average signal level to zero, which is crucial for the correct performance of other processing steps. The average signal level is calculated based on the final segment of each trace, and this average is then subtracted from each sample.

## Subtract Mean (Dewow)
The **Subtract mean (dewow)** filter removes slow signal changes by subtracting the calculated mean value within a defined window, thereby improving data quality.

## Time Cut
The **Time cut** function allows for trimming the temporal data to a specified interval, focusing on the segments of interest in the signal.

## Background Removal
This function removes background noise from the signal, eliminating disturbances and allowing for clearer visualization of the actual signal in the data.

## Median XY-Filter
The **Median XY-filter** smooths the data, reducing noise while preserving sharp boundaries between structures in the echogram.

## Energy Decay
**Energy Decay** corrects for the energy decay of the signal over time, compensating for the loss of energy with increasing distance from the source.

## Bandpass Butterworth
The **Bandpass Butterworth** filter selectively allows frequencies within a defined range, enabling analysis of specific signal components.

## Gain - Energy Decay
The **Gain - Energy Decay** function amplifies the signal, particularly useful for analyzing data with a wide dynamic range.

## Processing Flow
The **Processing Flow** section outlines the complete data processing sequence used in this project, presenting the order of operations for optimal results.

## File Header
The **File Header** feature allows viewing and editing of the file header, containing information on acquisition parameters and data configuration.

## Show Line
The **Show Line** function visualizes the selected data profile, facilitating the analysis of the structure and characteristics of the signal along a specified line.

## Vectorization
Examples of **vectorization** in echograms are provided based on processed results, enabling the identification and separation of important structural elements within the signal.

## Bibliography
